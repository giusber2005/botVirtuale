# VIRTUALE_BOT

Hello there, this is a program to complete all the modules in your course in the VIRTUALE platform of the UNIBO university!
It will follow all the videos and respond to the quiz at the end of the course

To use it you will simply need to insert your own credentials and the id of the course module you want to follow
(example: click on the module you want to follow, there will be something like this in the URL "https://virtuale.unibo.it/mod/scorm/view.php?id={module})" you will find the id where there is the module variable

That's all!
enjoy :)
